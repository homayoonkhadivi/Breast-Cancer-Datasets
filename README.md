# Breast-Cancer-Datasets
Breast Cancer Datasets, Breast Cancer Prediction with SVM, PCA, Tuning
I want to show how a Data Scientist would address a technical problem by analyzing the breast cancer datasets from three excel files such as (Death, Recovered, Under Treatment) through conducting some technical activities such as:

The preparation of the breast cancer for support vector machine algorithm
Visualization and data exploratory of the dataset to know better the data and feature engineering steps
Support Vector Machine kernels (Linear, Polynomial, Radial)
Conducting the Support vector machine hyperparameter tuning
Conducting the Principal Component Analysis and how to use it to reduce the complexity of a problem
The goal is to correctly predict if someone weather would have Benign or malignant tumor
